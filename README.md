### -Hello people!ðŸ‘‹
### This is your allmighty overlord SaintBenjamino here, conqueror of the lands between and eater of the elden donut.
### If we get to choose pronouns here, I'm gonna go with It/Its because it is the most confusing yet awesome pronoun.
### Wait. Is It even a pronoun? Is it a Clown? Is it that thing from wrinkle in time? 
### IDK Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
### Well anyways I like rock climbing
### And playing too much Elden Ring because it is an amazing video game
### You should play it
### I live in an average sized megafortress with a deluxe dungeon and two ancient blue dragons to gaurd it.
### Their names are Abbott and Costello, like the aliens in Arrival.
### A GREAT movie which you should watch.
### I want to learn how to do real pixar-style animation, but this does not seem to be the right format for that. 
### COmputer science is cool because it is what I am doing right now and I look smart doing it.
### I play a lot of DND, mostly as the DM
### My UVU buddies are Ty, Marie, Jared, Anissa, Shantelle, and that loud guy with the tiny sideburns who I cannot remember his name for the life of me.
### I like OK GO and similair music, but basically every type of music is good.
### But yeah thats me.
